# Synopsis

This is a test to create a booking API. We'll be using doctolib as an example.

**_A Doctor does not have enough time to answer all his phone calls to take new appointments._**

### Guidelines

1. Develop a web service to obtain all the availabilities from the medical cabinet for a specific date.

- URL: http://localhost:3000/visits
- Method used: GET
- Query params: "date" (example: "2019-01-31")
- GET: http://localhost:3000/visits?date=2019-01-31 will return a status 200 with an object including all the times slots available for this date.

2. The second web service will be used to book a time slot.

- URL: http://localhost:3000/visits
- Method used: POST
- Query params:
  - "date" (example: "2019-01-31")
  - "slot" (example: "1500" for 3pm)
  - "name" (example: "John")
- POST : we will post an object to http://localhost:3000/visits using the query params specified above. It will return a status 200 with a message saying "successfully booked"
- If the time slot is unaivalable, we will receive a status 400 with the message "slot already booked".

ðŸš§ Functionalities to come ...

- Use npm date-fns to make sure a client cannot reserve a date in the past.
- Cannot book a slot on a Sunday
- Create a web service to cancel a reservation.
